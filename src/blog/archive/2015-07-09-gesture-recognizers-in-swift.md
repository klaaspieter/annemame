I wrote about using [Gesture Recognizers in Swift](https://thatthinginswift.com/gesture-recognizers-swift/) for [thatthinginswift.com](https://thatthinginswift.com).

I ran into a couple of surprises using gesture recognizers in Swift. Nothing major, but definitely things to look out for. Head over to [the article](https://thatthinginswift.com/gesture-recognizers-swift) to read more about it.

Nick is also looking for more contributors. If you're interested send a [PR](https://github.com/nickoneill/thatthinginswift/pulls). If you need inspiration for topics take a look at issues [8](https://github.com/nickoneill/thatthinginswift/issues/8).
