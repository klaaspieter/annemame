<p>After some delay it's finally here. Welcome to my blog! I intend to post here whenever I learn something new and interesting. I don't have a specific subject in mind, but it will certainly have to do with usability, design and software.</p>
<p>The reason for me to start this blog is that I like talking about things I learn. Of course it's also kind of mandatory to have a blog nowadays.</p>
<p>I intend to talk about the things I'm currently working on, provided I <em>can</em> talk about them. For now, this post will have to do. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to <a href="feed://feeds.feedburner.com/annemame">see you again</a> soon!</p>
