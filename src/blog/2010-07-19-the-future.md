Most of you probably already know, but for those who don’t; the company I work at, [Sofa][] was acquired by [Facebook][Acquisition blogpost]. For reasons I can’t disclose I was not part of the acquisition.

The last couple of weeks have been a very emotional and busy period. Over the course of two weeks I went from having a job I enjoyed, to moving to the Bay Area for a job at Facebook, to having no job at all. In other words my future was destroyed, recreated and destroyed again. 

Even though Facebook wasn’t an option, I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to move to the US. I got a ton of job offers during WWDC and I spend most of my time pursuing them trying to find a job in San Francisco.

While I was interviewing at another company I got an email from Sofa’s partner in [Checkout][], [Acclivity][]. They wanted me to stop by New Jersey on my way back home to talk about my future and offered me an opportunity to continue development on [Enstore][] and Checkout. Although I had set my mind on San Francisco this was an opportunity too good to pass by.

I’ll be part of a newly formed NYC based company responsible for Enstore and Checkout. My wife and I will be moving to New York City as soon as my visa is arranged. Suggestions where to live, eat and spend our spare time are very welcome.

In closing I would like to thank all the companies that offered me a job and all the great people that helped me out trying to find a new job! The last couple of months have been a hard and emotional period, but I’m sure the future will make up for it.
