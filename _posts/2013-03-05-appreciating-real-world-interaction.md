Moving to New York and having to quickly adept to a completely different culture has really opened up my eyes to a lot of beautiful interactions we encounter during our everyday lives. This inspired me to start [realworlddetails.com](http://realworlddetails.com) to celebrate some of the great interactions we tend to overlook because of our busy lives.

As a software user, and developer; I've come to enjoy [consuming](http://littlebigdetails.com/) and [creating](http://littlebigdetails.com/post/43078037323/karma-when-searching-on-the-infamous-90210-zip#_=_) these fun details. Some of these details truly make our lives easier, while others are just for fun. Regardless, they will all put a smile on your face when you become aware of them. With [realworlddetails.com](http://realworlddetails.com), I hope to make all of us more appreciative of the many things we encounter during our day. Whether [waiting in line](http://realworlddetails.com/post/24333231750/the-lines-at-whole-foods-are-fully-automated) at the grocery store, [shopping at Ikea](http://realworlddetails.com/post/23867068143/ikea-the-color-of-the-bag-indicates-their-use) or any other time we're not looking at a screen. Let's stop and look around for a minute.
